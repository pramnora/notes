I find myself being absolutely desperate to go work out how to learn to use both Git/GitHub.

All I really have to do is make up my mind to get on with learning it.

The trouble is there are, literally, millions and millions of web pages out there to go and discover; 
and, because I suffer from ADD/Attention Deficit Disorder; therefore, I find it really hard to keep 
my attention being fully focussed...?!

Nevertheless, I'm pretty damn sure I'll get it in the end; because when I'm seriously interested in learning something;
be it anything at all whatsoever; then, I don't easily give up...whether it takes me...seconds/minutes/hours/
a day/days/weeks/months/years/decades/-etc.

So far today, I went and signed into my online GitHub a/c.; and, using the GUI I went and...
a> Created a few repos
b> Added some files into each repo I created
c> Practiced deleting a file from a repo
d> I also created a Gist

Later on, I went and downloaded what is the 'latest' version of GitHub for Windows 2.0. Then, I...
a> Created more repos (folders)
b> Learned to add files into these 
c> Learned to sync between folders/files being listed on my home computer/and, the remote GitHub server directory 
that is viewable inside of the web browser
d> Learned to delete files/and, also, how to delete whole entire folder directories (even if they contain files inside)

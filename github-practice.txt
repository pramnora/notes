I am keen to learn how to use both 'Git/GitHub' most effectively; 
because nearly all programmers now-a-days tend to use it.

So far today, I went and signed into my online GitHub a/c.; used the web browser based GUI to...

a> Create a few repos
b> Added some files into each repo I created
c> Practiced deleting a file from a repo
d> I also created a Gist

Later on, I went and downloaded what is the 'latest' version of GitHub for Windows 2.0. Then, on my home computer...

a> Created more repos (folders)
b> Learned to add files into these 
c> Learned to sync between folders/files being listed on my home computer/and, the remote GitHub server directory 
that is viewable inside of the web browser
d> Learned to delete files/and, also, how to delete whole entire folder directories (even if they contain files inside)

However, this is just merely the beginning of my initial learning process; 
as there is still so much more to go learn. In particular, I don't know how to...

a> merge
b> fork/branch
c> use the command line
d> collaborate
(...and, who knows whatever else I...as somebody who is a total 'beginner'...might have left out?! Etc.)
